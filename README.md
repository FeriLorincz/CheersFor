# CheersFor
Android mobile app with Java to appreciate user's colleagues.


# CheersFor: Employee Appreciation App
# Project Overview
CheersFor is a mobile app built in Java using Android Studio. It helps employees in big companies compliment their coworkers.

# How It Works

Users answer short surveys about their colleagues.
Each survey has 4 buttons with coworkers' names.
Users also share positive stories about work.
If a story isn't positive, ChatGPT suggests changes.
Users can read stories from other companies.

# Key Features
LinkedIn Integration (Planned)

Users would log in with LinkedIn.
The app would find current and former coworkers.
It would look for people who worked together at the same time.

# Surveys

Example question: "Who would you like to work with on a tough new project?"
Users pick a coworker by pressing a button with their name.

# Bonus Points

Voting in a survey: 1 point
Sharing a story: 10 points
If the voted coworker has a CheersFor account, they get 1 point too.

# Inviting Coworkers

If a voted coworker doesn't have an account, they get an email.
The email tells them someone appreciated them on CheersFor.

# Privacy Options

Users can vote anonymously or show their name.
This option is available for both surveys and stories.

# Dynamic Content

The app has a list of survey and story questions.
Questions change based on how often the user uses the app.
This keeps the app interesting and not repetitive.

# Challenges We Face

Can't connect to LinkedIn API yet.
Hard to get users' work history and coworker lists.
Need to find a use for bonus points to keep users coming back.
Need to make money to cover costs (LinkedIn, Google Firestore, ChatGPT).

# Current Status

We've paused the project because:

We can't get email addresses from LinkedIn.
It's hard to find where and when users worked without LinkedIn data.
LinkedIn might only give this data if they owned the app.

# What Is Ready

The stories part of the app.


# What We Learned

Even though we had to stop, we learned a lot in three weeks of work.
Future Plans
We hope to find solutions to these problems and continue the project someday.
